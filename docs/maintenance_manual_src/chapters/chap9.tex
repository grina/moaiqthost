\section{Unofficial Linux implementation of Moai SDK}

Currently there is no officially supported version of Moai SDK on Linux platform, so an unofficial version by spacepluk is used (\url{https://github.com/spacepluk/moai-dev}). 
Because of this configuring the Moai SDK on Linux might be more difficult.
Probably for the same reason mp3 music files don't work with UNTZ on Linux.

\section{Features that have not been tested}

Following Moai Qt Host qmake configurations have not been tested: audiosampler, fmod\_designer, debugger.

\section{3rd party debuggers}

Using 3rd party debuggers (such as ZeroBrane Studio) with Moai Qt Host has not been tested and might not work.

\section{Working directory}

Moai Qt Host assumes that the working directory is the same where the binary is run from.
