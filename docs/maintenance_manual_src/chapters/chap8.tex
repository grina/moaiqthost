\chapter{Reporting and documents}

\section{Notice of change or correction}

Every issue found in the application should be announced on the \emph{Issues}
page of the GitHub repository. Issues must be well explained for the developers
to be able to understand and fix them. With clear bugs the used system
environment should be specified along with the required steps to reproduce the
bug.

To implement a desired feature or fix a bug the repository on GitHub can be
forked. Once the changes are made and pushed to the forked repository a
\emph{Pull request} should be made. After that someone with push access to the
original repository can merge the changes to update the application. For more
information see \url{https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests}. 

\section{System documents and their location}

This document as well as the User Manual along with their LaTeX sources can be
found from the repository under the folder \emph{docs}.

\section{Documents that are not maintained}

All of the documents should be kept up to date at all times.
